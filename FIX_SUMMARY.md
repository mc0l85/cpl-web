# Fix Summary: License Recapture Classification Issue

## Problem
Users with recent activity were being incorrectly classified as "License Recapture" despite having activity within the last 90 days. 

**Specific Issue:**
- User `kamila.x.rodrigues@haleon.com` had activity on 2025-06-26
- Latest report date was 2025-07-22 (only 26 days of inactivity)
- User was still classified as "License Recapture"

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `get_manager_classification` method in `analysis_logic.py`. The logic flow was:

1. Check if user is new (first seen within 90 days) ✅
2. Check if user has no activity for >90 days ✅
3. Classify based on consistency levels:
   - >75% consistency + >10 complexity → Power User
   - >75% consistency → Consistent User  
   - >25% consistency → Coaching Opportunity
   - **Default case → License Recapture** ❌

The problem was that users with low consistency (≤25%) but recent activity were falling through to the default "License Recapture" classification, even though they had recent activity.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Overall Recency Calculation
**File:** `analysis_logic.py` (Lines 155-158)
**Change:** Enhanced the calculation of `last_activity` to ensure it captures the absolute maximum date across all tools and reports.

**Before:**
```python
first_activity, last_activity = activity_dates.min(), activity_dates.max()
```

**After:**
```python
# Ensure we're getting the absolute maximum date across all tools and reports
all_tool_dates = user_data[copilot_tool_cols].values.flatten()
all_tool_dates = pd.to_datetime(all_tool_dates[pd.notna(all_tool_dates)])
last_activity = all_tool_dates.max() if len(all_tool_dates) > 0 else activity_dates.max() if len(activity_dates) > 0 else pd.NaT
first_activity = activity_dates.min()
```

### 2. Fixed Default Classification Logic
**File:** `analysis_logic.py` (Line 66)
**Change:** Changed the default classification from "License Recapture" to "Coaching Opportunity"

**Before:**
```python
return "License Recapture"
```

**After:**
```python
return "Coaching Opportunity"  # Changed default from "License Recapture" to "Coaching Opportunity"
```

## Impact of Changes

### Before Fix:
- Users with recent activity but low consistency were incorrectly classified as "License Recapture"
- This could lead to unnecessary license reallocation for active users
- The justification text was misleading: "User has not shown any activity in the last 90 days"

### After Fix:
- Users with recent activity are now correctly classified based on their consistency level
- Users with ≤25% consistency get "Coaching Opportunity" classification
- Only users with truly no activity for >90 days get "License Recapture" classification
- Justification text now accurately reflects the user's actual status

## Testing

### Test Coverage
1. **Unit Tests:** Created comprehensive test suite covering all classification scenarios
2. **Specific User Test:** Verified the fix works for the reported user case
3. **Edge Cases:** Tested boundary conditions (exactly 90 days, etc.)

### Test Results
- ✅ All 6 test cases pass
- ✅ Specific user `kamila.x.rodrigues@haleon.com` now correctly classified as "Coaching Opportunity"
- ✅ Truly inactive users still correctly classified as "License Recapture"
- ✅ All other classification categories work as expected

## Files Modified
1. `analysis_logic.py` - Main classification logic fix
2. `simple_test_classification.py` - Test suite (created)
3. `test_actual_fix.py` - Comprehensive test (created)
4. `FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document (created)

## Verification Steps
1. Run the test suite: `python3 simple_test_classification.py`
2. Run comprehensive test: `python3 test_actual_fix.py`
3. Verify that users with recent activity are no longer classified as "License Recapture"
4. Confirm that truly inactive users are still correctly classified

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Revert the changes in `analysis_logic.py`:
   - Line 66: Change back to `return "License Recapture"`
   - Lines 155-158: Revert to original `first_activity, last_activity = activity_dates.min(), activity_dates.max()`
2. Re-run tests to verify behavior
3. Document any unexpected behavior

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Users with activity within 90 days are NOT classified as "License Recapture"
- ✅ Users with no activity for >90 days ARE classified as "License Recapture"
- ✅ All test cases pass
- ✅ The specific reported user case is resolved
- ✅ Other classification categories remain unaffected
