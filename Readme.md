## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps in your Linux terminal to get the application running on your local machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, you need to download the project files. We'll use **git** to "clone" the repository from its source.

```bash
# This command downloads the project into a new folder called "copilot-web-app"
git clone <repository_url>

# Now, move into the newly created project directory
cd copilot-web-app
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

It's highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment to manage project dependencies. This prevents conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required Python packages
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib openpyxl flask flask-socketio eventlet
```

Remember to activate the virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate`) every time you open a new terminal and want to work on this project. To deactivate it, simply run `deactivate`.

## üß™ Testing

This project uses `pytest` for testing. All tests are located in the `tests/` directory.

To run the tests, make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`) and then run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
pytest
```
