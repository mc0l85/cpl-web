## Evaluation of the RUI-Lite Proposal (Updated)

After reviewing your current implementation and the proposed Relative Use Index system with manager-based peer groups, here's my assessment:

### ‚úÖ **Strong Points**

1. **Much Fairer Than Current System**
   - Current: Binary 90-day cutoff for "License Recapture" is harsh
   - RUI: Multi-factor scoring with manager-based peer comparisons is far more equitable
   - Manager-based peer groups ensure apples-to-apples comparisons

2. **Anti-Gaming Mechanisms**
   - The "Good Standing" requirement (breadth ‚â• 1.5 tools + consistency) prevents single-tool pings
   - Trend component rewards improving users, protecting those actively adopting

3. **Data Compatibility**
   - Your current data structure already captures the needed signals:
     - `Last activity date of [tool]` columns ‚Üí can derive `last_active_in_week`
     - Tool usage counts ‚Üí already tracked
     - Weekly report structure ‚Üí matches proposal's needs
     - **NEW**: Manager hierarchy data enables peer group formation

4. **Transparency & Simplicity**
   - Single RUI score based on manager's team comparison
   - Clear 0-100 scale is intuitive vs current categorical system
   - Simple message: "You rank X among your immediate peers"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implementation Considerations**

1. **Complexity Jump**
   - Current: ~50 lines of classification logic
   - RUI: ~250 lines with percentile calculations and peer group logic
   - Simpler than original proposal due to single-tier comparison

2. **Parameter Tuning Required**
   - Default weights (40/30/20/10) seem reasonable but need validation
   - Half-life of 30 days for recency (more responsive)
   - Min-breadth of 2.0 for "good standing"
   - Minimum peer group size: 5 users

3. **Peer Group Formation**
   - Primary: Manager's direct reports (minimum 5 users)
   - Fallback: Walk up management chain until 5+ peers found
   - Ultimate fallback: Global comparison (only for C-suite)

### üîÑ **Migration Path Recommendations**

1. **Phase 1**: Add RUI calculation alongside existing classifications
2. **Phase 2**: Run both systems in parallel for 2-3 months to compare
3. **Phase 3**: Gradually shift weight to RUI-based decisions

### üìä **Key Improvements Over Current System**

| Aspect | Current | RUI-Lite | Impact |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| Recency | Binary (90 days) | Gradual decay (30-day half-life) | +++ Fairness |
| Consistency | Simple percentage | Percentile-based | ++ Comparability |
| Peer Comparison | None | Manager-based peer groups | ++++ Fairness |
| Trend Recognition | None | 10% weight | ++ Retention |
| Gaming Resistance | Limited | Multi-factor | ++ Integrity |
| Edge Cases | Manual handling | Automatic peer group escalation | +++ Robustness |

### üéØ **Verdict**

**Strongly recommend implementation** with these specifications:

1. **Peer Group Logic**:
   - Use manager's direct reports as primary peer group (minimum 5 users)
   - If <5, walk up management chain until sufficient peers found
   - Only use global comparison for C-suite edge cases

2. **RUI Thresholds**:
   - RUI ‚â• 40: License retained
   - RUI 20-39: Warning status
   - RUI < 20: Reclamation candidate
   - RUI < 10: Immediate reclaim if no recent activity

3. **Key Parameters**:
   - 30-day recency half-life
   - Min-breadth 2.0 for good standing
   - Component weights: Recency 40%, Frequency 30%, Breadth 20%, Trend 10%

The manager-based peer group approach ensures fair comparisons between users with similar tool usage expectations, while the automatic escalation handles edge cases elegantly. This is significantly fairer than the current binary system while remaining simple to explain and implement.

### üìà **Reporting Structure for Regional Leaders**

**New "RUI Analysis" Tab in Excel Report:**

| User | Manager | RUI | License Risk | Last Active | Peer Rank | Trend |
|------|---------|-----|--------------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Bob | Jane S. | 15 | High - Reclaim | 45 days ago | 8 of 8 | ‚Üì |
| Amy | Jane S. | 28 | Medium - Review | Yesterday | 6 of 8 | ‚Üí |
| Sue | Jane S. | 68 | Low - Retain | Today | 2 of 8 | ‚Üë |

**Manager Summary View:**

| Manager Name | Team Size | Avg RUI | High Risk | Medium Risk | Low Risk | Action Required |
|--------------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Jane Smith | 8 | 52 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 1 |
| John Doe | 6 | 38 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 2 |

**License Risk Categories:**
- **High Risk (RUI < 20)**: Recommend immediate license reclamation
- **Medium Risk (RUI 20-39)**: Review usage and notify user
- **Low Risk (RUI ‚â• 40)**: Retain license

## üìã **One Page Lesson (OPL): Understanding RUI**

### What is RUI?
**Relative Use Index (RUI)** is a fair scoring system (0-100) that compares each user's tool usage to their immediate peers (same manager's team).

### How is RUI Calculated?
RUI combines four factors to create a single score:

1. **Recency (40%)**: How recently you used the tools
   - Today = High score
   - 30+ days ago = Low score

2. **Frequency (30%)**: How often you use the tools
   - Daily use = High score
   - Rare use = Low score

3. **Breadth (20%)**: How many different tools you use
   - Using all tools = High score
   - Using one tool = Low score

4. **Trend (10%)**: Is your usage improving?
   - Increasing usage = Bonus points
   - Decreasing usage = Lower score

### What Does My RUI Mean?

| Your RUI | License Risk | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 40-100 | **Low Risk** ‚úÖ | Keep your license |
| 20-39 | **Medium Risk** ‚ö†Ô∏è | You'll receive a usage reminder |
| 0-19 | **High Risk** ‚ùå | License may be reclaimed |

### Why Peer Comparison?
You're compared to others who report to the same manager because:
- Your team has similar tool needs
- Your manager sets similar expectations
- It's fairer than comparing engineers to admins

### Example:
*"Sarah has an RUI of 35 (Medium Risk). She ranks 5 out of 7 on her team. While she used tools yesterday, her overall frequency and breadth are below her peers. She'll receive a reminder to increase her usage."*

### Key Takeaway:
**Use your tools regularly across different features to maintain a healthy RUI score.**
