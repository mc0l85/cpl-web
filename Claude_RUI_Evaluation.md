## Evaluation of the RUI-Lite Proposal (Updated)

After reviewing your current implementation and the proposed Relative Use Index system with manager-based peer groups, here's my assessment:

### ‚úÖ **Strong Points**

1. **Much Fairer Than Current System**
   - Current: Binary 90-day cutoff for "License Recapture" is harsh
   - RUI: Multi-factor scoring with manager-based peer comparisons is far more equitable
   - Manager-based peer groups ensure apples-to-apples comparisons

2. **Anti-Gaming Mechanisms**
   - The "Good Standing" requirement (breadth ‚â• 1.5 tools + consistency) prevents single-tool pings
   - Trend component rewards improving users, protecting those actively adopting

3. **Data Compatibility**
   - Your current data structure already captures the needed signals:
     - `Last activity date of [tool]` columns ‚Üí can derive `last_active_in_week`
     - Tool usage counts ‚Üí already tracked
     - Weekly report structure ‚Üí matches proposal's needs
     - **NEW**: Manager hierarchy data enables peer group formation

4. **Transparency & Simplicity**
   - Single RUI score based on manager's team comparison
   - Clear 0-100 scale is intuitive vs current categorical system
   - Simple message: "You rank X among your immediate peers"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implementation Considerations**

1. **Complexity Jump**
   - Current: ~50 lines of classification logic
   - RUI: ~250 lines with percentile calculations and peer group logic
   - Simpler than original proposal due to single-tier comparison

2. **Parameter Tuning Required**
   - Default weights (40/30/20/10) seem reasonable but need validation
   - Half-life of 30 days for recency (more responsive)
   - Min-breadth of 2.0 for "good standing"
   - Minimum peer group size: 5 users

3. **Peer Group Formation (UPDATED)**
   - Primary: Direct team comparison (5+ users under same manager)
   - Strategy 2: Skip-level peers (cousins under same skip-level manager)
   - Strategy 3: Organizational unit (all users under common manager at any level)
   - Managers excluded from subordinate peer groups (no comparing with your boss)
   - Ultimate fallback: Department or global (rare cases only)

### üîÑ **Migration Path Recommendations**

1. **Phase 1**: Add RUI calculation alongside existing classifications
2. **Phase 2**: Run both systems in parallel for 2-3 months to compare
3. **Phase 3**: Gradually shift weight to RUI-based decisions

### üìä **Key Improvements Over Current System**

| Aspect | Current | RUI-Lite | Impact |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| Recency | Binary (90 days) | Gradual decay (30-day half-life) | +++ Fairness |
| Consistency | Simple percentage | Percentile-based | ++ Comparability |
| Peer Comparison | None | Manager-based peer groups | ++++ Fairness |
| Trend Recognition | None | 10% weight | ++ Retention |
| Gaming Resistance | Limited | Multi-factor | ++ Integrity |
| Edge Cases | Manual handling | Automatic peer group escalation | +++ Robustness |

### üéØ **Verdict**

**Strongly recommend implementation** with these specifications:

1. **Peer Group Logic (IMPLEMENTED)**:
   - Strategy 1: Self + direct subordinates (for managers with 5+ reports)
   - Strategy 2: Direct manager's team (5+ peers under same manager, excluding manager)
   - Strategy 3: Skip-level peers (5+ cousins under same skip-level manager)
   - Strategy 4: Organizational unit (walk up chain to find 5+ users under common manager)
   - Managers never counted as peers of their subordinates (James Peterson ‚â† Mark Rothfuss's peer)
   - Consistent peer group sizes for all members of same group

2. **RUI Thresholds**:
   - New Users (< 90 days): Automatic grace period, protected from reclamation
   - RUI ‚â• 40: License retained
   - RUI 20-39: Warning status
   - RUI < 20: Reclamation candidate
   - RUI < 10: Immediate reclaim if no recent activity

3. **Key Parameters**:
   - 30-day recency half-life
   - Min-breadth 2.0 for good standing
   - Component weights: Recency 40%, Frequency 30%, Breadth 20%, Trend 10%

The manager-based peer group approach ensures fair comparisons between users with similar tool usage expectations, while the automatic escalation handles edge cases elegantly. This is significantly fairer than the current binary system while remaining simple to explain and implement.

### üîß **Recent Improvements & Bug Fixes**

1. **Peer Group Formation Fixed**:
   - Mark Rothfuss correctly groups with ~11 people under Peter Obasa (not 273 globally)
   - Managers properly excluded from subordinate peer groups
   - Consistent peer group sizes for all members

2. **Manager Report Aggregation**:
   - Automatically aggregates small teams to meaningful groups (5+ users)
   - Shows organizational level (Direct Manager, Skip-Level, Department)
   - Eliminates single-person manager entries

3. **Excel Formatting Cleaned**:
   - Removed unintended neon green backgrounds in Leaderboard column D
   - Fixed red text appearing in column E
   - Maintains proper alternating row striping

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - 90-day grace period properly applied to new users
   - Manager hierarchy correctly parsed (ManagerLine doesn't include user)
   - Peer group escalation stops at appropriate organizational level

### üìà **Reporting Structure for Regional Leaders**

**New "RUI Analysis" Tab in Excel Report:**

| User | Manager | RUI | License Risk | Last Active | Peer Rank | Trend |
|------|---------|-----|--------------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Bob | Jane S. | 15 | High - Reclaim | 45 days ago | 8 of 8 | ‚Üì |
| Amy | Jane S. | 28 | Medium - Review | Yesterday | 6 of 8 | ‚Üí |
| Sue | Jane S. | 68 | Low - Retain | Today | 2 of 8 | ‚Üë |

**Manager Summary View (ENHANCED):**

| Manager/Group | Org Level | Team Size | Avg RUI | High Risk | Medium Risk | Low Risk | New Users | Action Required |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Peter Obasa | Department | 11 | 52 | 1 | 2 | 6 | 2 | 1 |
| Dan Basile | Skip-Level | 8 | 38 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 2 |

*Note: Report aggregates to meaningful group sizes (5+ users) to avoid single-person entries*

**License Risk Categories:**
- **New User (< 90 days)**: Protected grace period for onboarding
- **High Risk (RUI < 20)**: Recommend immediate license reclamation (except new users)
- **Medium Risk (RUI 20-39)**: Review usage and notify user
- **Low Risk (RUI ‚â• 40)**: Retain license

## üìã **One Page Lesson (OPL): Understanding RUI**

### What is RUI?
**Relative Use Index (RUI)** is a fair scoring system (0-100) that compares each user's tool usage to their immediate peers (same manager's team).

### How is RUI Calculated?
RUI combines four factors to create a single score:

1. **Recency (40%)**: How recently you used the tools
   - Today = High score
   - 30+ days ago = Low score

2. **Frequency (30%)**: How often you use the tools
   - Daily use = High score
   - Rare use = Low score

3. **Breadth (20%)**: How many different tools you use
   - Using all tools = High score
   - Using one tool = Low score

4. **Trend (10%)**: Is your usage improving?
   - Increasing usage = Bonus points
   - Decreasing usage = Lower score

### What Does My RUI Mean?

| Your RUI | License Risk | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Any score | **New User** üÜï | 90-day grace period (protected) |
| 40-100 | **Low Risk** ‚úÖ | Keep your license |
| 20-39 | **Medium Risk** ‚ö†Ô∏è | You'll receive a usage reminder |
| 0-19 | **High Risk** ‚ùå | License may be reclaimed |

**Important**: New users (less than 90 days since first appearance) are automatically protected during their learning period, regardless of RUI score.

### Why Peer Comparison?
You're compared to others in your organizational unit because:
- Your team has similar tool needs and workflows
- Your manager sets similar expectations for the team
- It's fairer than comparing engineers to admins or sales to finance
- The system finds the right comparison group (usually 5-15 people at your organizational level)

### How Are Peer Groups Formed?
The system automatically finds the right comparison group for you:
1. **First**: Looks at your immediate manager's team
2. **If too small**: Includes your organizational cousins (people at your level)
3. **If still too small**: Expands to your department or division
4. **Goal**: Find 5-15 people with similar roles and expectations

**Note**: Your manager is never included as your peer - you're compared with colleagues, not supervisors.

### Example:
*"Sarah has an RUI of 35 (Medium Risk). She ranks 5 out of 7 on her team. While she used tools yesterday, her overall frequency and breadth are below her peers. She'll receive a reminder to increase her usage."*

### Key Takeaway:
**Use your tools regularly across different features to maintain a healthy RUI score.**
